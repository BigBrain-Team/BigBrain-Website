# Hardware
Before we jump into the inner-workings 
of the livestream, let's go over the basics
on the **hardware**:

1. Soundboard
2. Camera(s)
3. Computer
4. Extra Monitors

#### **Soundboard**
### Soundboard
- This is the only place the livestream should get
it's sound.

- Usually, there is a dedicated sound person so the 
livestream person does not need to worry about the knobs.

- Just know that sound should be coming **ONLY** from this.


#### **Camera(s)**
### Camera(s)
- Video feed comes from these devices.

#### **Computer**
### Computer
- The computer either runs on macOS or Windows 10.
- It is responsible for connecting all of the hardware together, and it streams to YouTube.
- Almost all input is through `USB`. 


#### **Extra Monitors**
### Extra Monitors
- This is quite explanatory
- It gives the livestream person more space to 
configure and manage the stream.

But how do we connect all of these peices together?
It might be fairly obvious that these devices do not work
seamlessly togehter. Luckily, with the help of **converters**, 
it is somewhat possible.
