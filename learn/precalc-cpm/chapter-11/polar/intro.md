# Introduction to Polar Functions
## The New System
Remember graphing with $(x,y)$ on **cartesian graphs**? Those are called **rectangular coordinates**.

*Cartesian Graph*

This chapter will go over **polar coordinates**, which instead <u>graphs distance and angle.</u>
They are represented as $(r, \theta)$.

?> **Important:** always stick with <u>radians.</u>

Above is a **polar coordinate** on a cartesian graph.

### Basic Terms
* **pole** - center of the plane. *(origin of the polar graph)*
* **r** - distance the **pole**
* **polar axis** - axis which the radius is measured with. Sometimes refered as the *radius axis*.
* $\theta$ - angle (look at reference above)

## Graphing Polar Coordinates
Below is a **polar coordinate** on a **polar graph**.

One of the axis represent radius while the other represents the angle.

### Interactive Graph Instructions
* Drag the *<span style="color:green">green dot</span>* to change $\theta$
* Drag the *<span style="color:purple">purple dot</span>* to change $r$
* The *red dot* is the point and is given the label $(x,y)$
