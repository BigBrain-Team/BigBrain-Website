## Parametric Equations
### Problems with Plane Curves With Only (x,y) 

1. Many plane curves are not functions
2. Don't tell where objects are at a given "time"
3. Do not show direction

## Parameters

$$
x=f(T), y=f(T)
$$

Motion defined in the x and y directions are a function of some variable "T" over a common domain "I"

"T" is the Parameter 

"I" is the Parameter Interval 

### **I = [a,b]    "T" starts at a, ends at b**

**<u>Initial Point:</u> (x,y)**
T=a -> **(**f(a), g(a)**)**

to **<u>Terminal Point:</u> (x,y)**
T=b -> **(** f(b), g(b)**)**
