# Conic Section Equations
We are finally here! 
Not too many equations actually.

!> ***These are just the plain equations. You do not need to memorize these right off the bat, but you will need to have a feel for these equations and eventually memorize them.***

## Equations
<!-- tabs:start -->
#### **Parabola**

### Definitions
A **parabola** is the set of points that are equidistant from a fixed point (**focus**) and a line (**directrix**).

**focal length** or **$c$** is the distance form the vertex to the focus **or** directrix.

### Equation
*Vertex is $(h,k)$*

**If the parabola is vertical**

$
y=\frac{1}{4c}\left(x-h\right)^2+k
$

**If the parabola is horizontal** *(AKA "Sleeping parabola")*

$
x=\frac{1}{4c}\left(y-k\right)^2+h
$



#### **Hyperbola**

### Definitions
An **hyperbola** is the set of points which the *difference* of the distances from two fixed points are constant.

Like the parabola, there are two types.

### Hyperbola with Transverse Axis Parallel to the x-axis

$ \frac{\left(x-h\right)^2}{a^2}-\frac{\left(y-k\right)^2}{b^2}=1\ $
* Center at (h,k)
* Vertices at (h$\pm$a,k)
* Co-Vertices at (h,k$\pm$b)
* Transverse Axis Length = 2a
* Conjugate Axis Length = 2b
* Foci at (h$\pm$c,k)
* Asymptotes: $y=\pm\frac{b}{a}\left(x-h\right)+k$

### Finding the Foci *(Both Variations)*
$c^2=a^2+b^2$

Once you find $c$, you can find each foci with $(h\pm c,k)$

### Hyperbola with Transverse Axis Parrallel to the y-axis

$ \frac{\left(y-k\right)^2}{a^2}-\frac{\left(x-h\right)^2}{b^2}=1 $
* Center at $(h,k)$
* Vertices at $(h,k\pm a)$
* Co-Vertices at $(h\pm a,k)$
* Trasnverse Axis Length = $2a$
* Conjugate Axis Length = $2b$
* Foci at $(h,k\pm  a)$
* Asymptotes: $y=\pm\frac{a}{b}\left(x-h\right)+k$

#### **Circle**

### Equation
$(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$
* Center at $(h,k)$
* Nothing special; foci is the center

!> **IMPORTANT:** Many questions will require you to know that *ANY* tangential line is perpundicular to the line formed by the radius.

#### **Ellipse**

### Definitions
An **ellipse** is the set of points which the *sum* of the distances from two fixed points are constant.

Like the hyperbola, there are two **focal points**.

There are two axis on the ellipse:
1. **Major Axis** - end points are **vertices**
2. **Minor Axis** - end points are **co-vertices**

!> The longer side axis is *ALWAYS* the major axis

* $a$ stands for the length of *half* of the **Major Axis**
* $b$ stands for the length of *half* of the **Minor Axis**
* $c$ stands for the length from the center to a **focal point.**

### Finding the Foci *(Both Variations)*
To find the foci, you must use the equation:
$a^2-b^2=c^2$

Once you find $c$, the process is very similar to the hyperbola. Knowing that the <u>focal points are always along the **major axis**</u>, we can add or subtract $c$ from the center to find the exact coordinates. For example, if a horizontal ellipse was centered at $(1, 2)$ and $c=3$, the focal points are $(1\pm 3, 2)$.

### Equation and Points
?> _Note:_ The ellipse equation is almost identical to the hyperbola! Instead of subtracting, we are adding.

$\frac{\left(x-h\right)^2}{a^2}+\frac{\left(y-k\right)^2}{b^2}=1$


#### Main Points
* **Center:** $(h, k)$
* **Focal Points:** $(h\pm c, k)$ *Horizontal Ellipse*
* **Focal Points:** $(h, k\pm c)$ *Vertical Ellipse*

#### Vertex
* **Vertex:** $(h\pm a, k)$ *Horizontal Ellipse*
* **Co-vertex:** $(h\pm b, k)$ *Horizontal Ellipse*
* **Vertex:** $(h, k\pm a)$ *Vertical Ellipse*
* **Co-vertex:** $(h, k\pm b)$ *Vertical Ellipse*
